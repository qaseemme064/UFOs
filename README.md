# **UFOs**
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a clean webpage that contains a dynamic table of UFO sighting data. In this exercise, we reviewed how to display default data in the table, listen for a button click or trigger the table to update based on the user's input with a select criteria. In the end, we used HTML, Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a webpage that is easy to view which includes filters

## Results
Below is the HTML page that we built

Once entering the website we will see the basic opening and title with the picture at the top, as we scrolls down we will see all the data and filters that we have. From the below image we have 5 different filters to choose from; the date, city, state, country & shape. You can choose any of these filters enter the search bar, then the HTML page will show all of the sightings for that specific search.

## Summary

### *Drawback*

One drawback is that Javascript language is case sensitive. This impact the user experience because all of the searchable data is lowercase. If a user enter "CA" to identify the UFO sightings in California, the filter search results are zero. Whereas, if they were to enter "ca" in lower case, there are plenty of results.

### *Recommendations*

There are around 6 to 7 "shape" results for the shape filter.  A dropdown option will enhance the user experience if there were a dropdown option for "Shape" due to the broad range of descriptions. Those unfamiliar with UFO sightings may not know that "light" is considered a shape for UFOs.
